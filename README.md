Requirements:

Linux
Golang 1.17+
ImageMagick
Zip

Factorio Headless 1.1+

Launching will create default auto-config and save them.
Binary needs to be able to create files and directories in its own directory, and up one directory.

Discord token, guildid and channelid, and also factorio username and token are required.



Default path layout:

A 'base' folder the chatwire folder resides in.
/something/

For ChatWire:
/something/cw-a/ChatWire-Binary-here

Factorio:
/something/fact-a/
Binary:
/something/fact-a/bin/x64/Factorio

the "factorio prefix" is the "fact-" part.
the "chatwire prefix" is the "cw-" part.
the "call sign" is the "a" part.

This is setup to have many servers running, and so some files and directories are setup to be common.
